-  What's the best way to make sure you're integrating the most secure versions of your project dependencies? 

Configure your package files to always use the latest versions of dependencies.

Check each project's security details closely before adding it to your dependencies by confirming its version status across multiple advisory sites.
Even if this practice helps you start off with a secure version of a given dependency, it won't ensure that you're safe from future vulnerabilities. You would need to constantly monitor every package to ensure compliance, which might be infeasible.


Enable Dependabot for your repository.
Dependabot scans your repository's dependency manifests and notifies you via pull request whenever a version you rely is marked as insecure.

- Draft pull request - When you create a pull request, you can choose to either create a pull request that’s ready for review or a draft pull request. A pull request with a draft status can’t be merged, and code owners aren’t automatically requested to review draft pull requests.
